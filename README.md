# Elsa's initial repository
Here you will find some of the most interesting programming projects that I made during my learning process of coding with Javascript.

The files deposited here are meant to help other persons to compare codes, to help understanding some coding concepts that I learned by making this exercises and to have fun while learning.

# How to reach me?

# What will happen? 
As I inrich this repository, I hope it represents the growth that I will be having by learning more and more complex concepts in this new field for me.

I hope the visitors in my repository and GitHub profile enjoy exploring this learning path with me.
